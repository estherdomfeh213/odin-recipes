    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A recipe from my home in Emilia-Romagna, Italy. <br>This lasagne verde made with spinach pasta cannot be beaten. <br>It's excellent if you want to impress some guests — or even yourself. <br>It may be a bit time-consuming, but it's well worth the TLC you put into it.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>10 quarts (9 liters) salted water</li>
      <li>1 recipe Spinach Pasta cut for lasagna</li>
      <li>1 recipe Bechamel Sauce</li>
      <li>1 recipe Country Style Ragu</li>
      <li>1 cup (4 oz./125g) freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Oil or butter a 3 quart (approx 3 litres) shallow baking dish</li>
      <li>Bring the salted water to a boil. Drop about four pieces of pasta in the water at a time. Cook about 2 minutes</li>
     <li>Spread a thin layer of béchamel over the bottom of the baking dish. Arrange a layer of about four overlapping sheets of pasta over the béchamel.</li>
     <li> Cover the baking dish lightly with foil, taking care not to let it touch the top of the lasagne. Bake 40 minutes, or until almost heated through.</li>
     <li>Turn off the oven, leave the door ajar and let the lasagne rest for about 10 minutes. Then serve. </li>
    </ol>
